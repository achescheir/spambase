# spambase
The Jupyter Notebook, spam_filter.ipynb contains the analysis and calculations. The last couple of cells show the best filter I found and it's performance on the test set.

In order to work correctly the notebook requires a folder called spambase in its working directory. That folder must contain a file called spambase.data in the same format as the data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase
